# Tiktok's recommendation engine in 2024 

**Can you summarise this article about Tiktok's recommendation engine and add technical details based on their description: https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you**

TikTok's recommendation engine uses machine learning models to process multiple signals such as:

1. **User Interactions**: Likes, shares, comments, and content viewing duration help the system rank videos.
2. **Content Features**: Metadata like hashtags, sound tracks, and captions are analyzed to determine relevance.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Watch time, replays, and skips shape future recommendations.
4. **Collaborative Filtering**: The algorithm compares user behavior with similar profiles to recommend content.
5. **Diversity Mechanisms**: To prevent echo chambers, TikTok injects diverse and less common content into the feed.

Safety filters and moderation systems ensure inappropriate content is excluded.
